# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
puts 5
puts 2

puts 5 + 2
puts 5 * 2
puts 5 - 2
puts 5 / 2.0
puts (5 - 2) * 3

# Class note - Need to have a float decimal in order to get the remainder for the division line


# Non-numbers - always need to do double quotes
# Use Command / to make a text line
puts "Hello World!"
puts "Tacos are" + " delish"
puts "tacos " * 3

# True, False
# puts True
# puts False
puts 3 == 2

# Nothing

# Variables
zebra = 5
giraffe = 2

# puts zebra + giraffe
food = "tacos"
quantity = 3

puts food * quantity

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "I want #{} tacos"
puts "I want #{quantity} #{food}"

name = "Lucie"
puts "Hello #{name}!"

# Curly brackets tells computer that before you have this non-numeric value, evaluate some other Ruby code. 
# We do this so we can make things dynamic, like the greeting above

# String manipulation
